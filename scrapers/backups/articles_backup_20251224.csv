rigzone,2025-12-23,https://www.rigzone.com/news/wire/crude_extends_gains-23-dec-2025-182603-article/,"Oil gained for a fifth straight day in thin trading as investors weighed the US clampdown on shipments from Venezuela against weak demand. West Texas Intermediate rose 0.6% to settle above $58 a barrel, while Brent topped $62. The US has boarded one tanker, seized another and recently pursued a third near Venezuela, as Washington pressures the government of Nicolas Maduro. Still, nearly half a dozen tankers laden with crude have departed from Venezuela’s coast since the Trump administration intensified efforts to curb Caracas’ oil revenue. Volumes are trending lower ahead of the December holidays, with many traders away, contributing to exaggerated price swings. Trump has said the US will keep the oil from the seized tanker. Venezuelan exports represent less than 1% of global supply, but the revenue provides a financial lifeline for Maduro’s government, which has called the US actions piracy. Geopolitical stresses, including the threat of US land strikes against alleged drug operations in Latin America and the ongoing war in Ukraine, have helped arrest a slide in oil prices that has been underway since mid-June. WTI is down roughly 19% this year, heading for the biggest annual drop since 2020, as increasing supply outpaces demand. ""Price action looks increasingly prone to short-lived spikes rather than a sustained move higher,"" said Rebecca Reed-Sperrin, a broker at SCB Group and former derivatives broking desk head at Braemar. ""Even a sharp near-term drop in Venezuelan exports would still leave the market comfortably supplied into the first half of next year."" Commodity trading advisors, which can accelerate price momentum, liquidated short positions to sit at 91% short in WTI on Tuesday, compared with a maximum-short position on Dec. 23, according to data from Bridgeton Research Group. Meanwhile, a cargo of Russian crude from US-sanctioned Rosneft PJSC has finally been delivered to a Chinese oil terminal after spending three months at sea, ship-tracking data show. Delivering cargoes remains a challenge for Moscow, with a build-up of vessels anchored off the coasts of India and China. Oil Prices What do you think?

rigzone,2025-11-24,https://www.rigzone.com/news/wire/oeuk_awards_winners_revealed-24-nov-2025-182375-article/,"Industry body Offshore Energies UK’s (OEUK) 2025 awards ceremony took place in Aberdeen, Scotland, on Thursday night, crowning several winners across a range of categories. “In Aberdeen … [on Thursday], the UK’s offshore energy industry paused to celebrate its people - from those just starting out to those whose careers have spanned the North Sea’s six-decade story,” OEUK said in a statement sent to Rigzone. “At Offshore Energies UK’s (OEUK) 2025 Awards … the spotlight turned to the individuals and companies shaping the sector’s future, even as it faces a complex fiscal landscape and a subsequent downturn in activity,” it added. “The evening recognized young professionals bringing fresh ideas to established challenges, as well as the engineers, technicians, and leaders whose experience continues to anchor an industry in change,” it went on to state. OEUK Chief Executive David Whitehouse said in the statement that the night was a reminder of both the continuity and evolution within the energy workforce. “Our sector has always been defined by its people; their skills, resilience, and ingenuity,” Whitehouse added in the statement. “What we saw this evening is how that same spirit is driving innovation across carbon capture, hydrogen, and offshore wind, while continuing to deliver the oil and gas that the UK still depends on,” he added. “We hope the Autumn Budget recognizes the value of these skilled jobs and the communities they sustain,” he continued. “This is a story of transition, but also of continuity - of people who’ve powered the country for decades and are now helping to shape how it’s powered for decades to come,” Whitehouse said. The budget, or financial statement, is a statement made to the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the nation’s finances and the government’s proposals for changes to taxation, the UK parliament website states, adding that the government has announced that the next budget will take place on Wednesday, November 26.

The leases are Dominion Energy Inc's 2,600-megawatt (MW) Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW), Ørsted A/S' 924-MW Sunrise Wind east of Long Island, Equinor ASA's 810-MW Empire Wind 1 south of Long Island, Iberdrola SA and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners' 800-MW Vineyard Wind 1 south of Martha's Vineyard, Ørsted and Global Infrastructure Partners' 704-MW Revolution Wind off Rhode Island's southern coast. Interior cited ""recently completed classified reports"" by the War Department. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in the statement, ""Today's action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers"". Interior said, ""This pause will give the Department, along with the Department of War and other relevant government agencies, time to work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects"". ""As for the national security risks inherent to large-scale offshore wind projects, unclassified reports from the U.S. government have long found that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers create radar interference called 'clutter'"", Interior added. ""The clutter caused by offshore wind projects obscures legitimate moving targets and generates false targets in the vicinity of the wind projects"". According to statements from the affected companies, the pause means a 90-day work suspension. Dominion Energy said, ""Stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability for some of the nation’s most important war-fighting, AI and civilian assets. It will also lead to energy inflation and threaten thousands of jobs"". ""Our customers are paying for the project after a careful review of project costs and benefits by Virginia state regulators in 2022. These same state regulators, along with numerous federal agencies, oversee our cyber and physical security program, which is among the strongest in the energy industry"", the Richmond-based power and gas utility added. ""The project has been more than 10 years in the works, involved close coordination with the military and is located 27 to 44 miles offshore, so far offshore it does not raise visual impact concerns. The project's two pilot turbines have been operating for five years without causing any impacts to national security"". ""Virginia’s All-American, All-of-the-Above-Energy Plan requires a range of power generation assets, including natural gas, advanced nuclear and renewables"", Dominion said. ""Virginia needs every electron we can get as our demand for electricity doubles. These electrons will power the data centers that will win the AI race, support our war fighters and build the nuclear warships needed to maintain our maritime supremacy. ""We stand ready to do what is necessary to get these vital electrons flowing as quickly as possible"". Denmark's majority state-owned Ørsted said, ""Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously, together with its partners. This includes engagement with BOEM [Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management] and other permitting agencies as well as the evaluation of potential legal proceedings"". ""Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both in advanced stages of construction and will be ready to deliver reliable, affordable power to American homes in 2026, with Revolution Wind expected to begin generating power in January"", it added. ""As a requirement of the permitting process for these projects, Revolution Wind LLC and Sunrise Wind LLC consulted closely and directly with the U.S. Department of Defense Military Aviation and Installation Assurance Siting Clearinghouse to evaluate and address potential impacts to national security and defense capabilities from construction and operation of the Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects"", Ørsted noted. Norway's majority state-owned Equinor said, ""Empire plans to continue to work with BOEM and other federal agencies to continue to implement all necessary mitigation for the project"". ""The project is more than 60 percent complete, with trenching, cable-laying and cable pulling ongoing on the U.S. outer continental shelf. In total, dozens of vessels, around 1,000 people and more than a hundred companies in the US and globally have been working in coordination on the Empire Wind project"", it added.

Nashville ""marks INEOS' first successful exploration well in the region"", the British diversified company said in an online statement. ""The Nashville exploration well was drilled more than five miles beneath the seabed and confirmed high-quality oil in one of the Gulf's most promising deepwater formations"", INEOS said. ""Further technical work is now underway to determine the size of the find"", it said. The partners plan to develop the discovery as a tieback to the Appomattox production platform. Shell is operator of the well and the Appomattox hub with a 79 percent stake in each asset. INEOS owns 21 percent in each asset. ""This is a good result for INEOS Energy and an important step in building our presence in the U.S. Gulf where world-class resources are to be found and developed responsibly"", said INEOS chief executive David Bucknall. Earlier this year Shell put onstream a second tieback to the Appomattox production hub. Dover, discovered 2018 in Norphlet, produces 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day (boed) at peak, according to a statement by Shell April 8. Shell owns 100 percent of Dover. It estimates 44.5 million boe of proven and probable reserves in Dover. Shell approved the project in the first quarter of 2023. Dover is in the Mississippi Canyon in waters around 7,500 feet deep and about 170 miles off the southeast coast of New Orleans City, Louisiana, according to Shell. The first Appomattox tieback, Rydberg, went online in the first quarter of 2024. Rydberg has a capacity of 16,000 boed. Discovered 2014, it has proven and probable reserves of about 38 million boe, according to Shell. Rydberg is also within the Mississippi Canyon in the Norphlet Corridor. Rydberg is around 75 miles off the coast of Louisiana in approximately 7,450 feet of water, according to Shell. Also in 2025 in the Gulf, Shell put onstream the Whale field, expecting production of up to 100,000 boed. Shell operates Whale with a 60 percent stake. Chevron Corp owns 40 percent. Located in Alaminos Canyon Block 773, Whale features a semi-submersible production host in over 8,600 feet of water, according to Shell. Discovered 2017, Whale holds estimated proven and probable reserves of 480 million boe. Its production facility is adjacent to the Shell-operated Silvertip field and lies about 10 miles from the Perdido spar platform, also operated by Shell, according to the company.

The transaction has increased the oil giant's ownership in Petro Rabigh to 60 percent. Tokyo-based Sumitomo retains 15 percent. ""We look forward to exploring closer integration with Petro Rabigh, with the aim of unlocking new opportunities and complementing Petro Rabigh's broader transformation objectives, which include upgrading its product mix, enhancing asset reliability and optimizing operations"", Aramco senior vice president for fuels Hussain A. Al Qahtani said then. In October Aramco completed its acquisition of a 25 percent stake in Unioil Petroleum Philippines Ltd, taking over more than 175 retail stations and four storage terminals in the Southeast Asian country. ""Through this acquisition, Aramco continues to progress its strategic expansion of its global retail network in high-value markets"", Aramco said in its interim operational and financial report November 4. In China, Aramco in September formed Fujian Sinopec Aramco Refining and Petrochemical Co Ltd with China Petroleum & Chemical Corp and Fujian Petrochemical Co Ltd. The JV will build an integrated refining and petrochemical complex in the province. Expected to start production by 2030, the site will have an oil refining capacity of 16 million tons per annum (MMtpa) or 320,000 barrels per day, an ethylene production capacity of 1.5 MMtpa, a paraxylene and downstream derivatives capacity of two MMtpa and a 300,000-ton crude terminal. ""The project represents the third major manufacturing collaboration between Aramco and Sinopec in China, following the successful launch of the Fujian Refining & Petrochemical Co project in 2007 and Sinopec SABIC Tianjing Petrochemical Company in 2009"", Aramco said September 9. ""It is also the fifth joint venture between Aramco and Sinopec, extending their cooperation in refining and chemicals both in China and internationally"".

The European Commission, the EU executive body, said it would propose legal changes in the first half of 2026 to require stricter documentation for imports of recycled plastics. Another proposal will create separate customs codes for recycled and virgin plastics, to make it easier to track imports. ""The recycling sector is facing high energy costs, low and unpredictable prices for virgin plastic (linked to oil prices) and competition from imports of cheap plastics (often virgin plastics wrongly claimed to be recycled),"" the Commission said in a document setting out the plans. Other measures will include EU audits of recycling plants, including outside of Europe, and support for laboratories to run control checks on whether shipments of recycled plastic are genuine. Brussels will also consider whether it is necessary to introduce trade measures. An EU import surveillance task force will monitor plastics imports during 2026, the Commission said. The EU has already imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese PET plastic - the type used to make bottles - to address imports which Brussels said were so cheap they forced EU companies to sell at a loss to compete. Six European countries, including France, Spain and the Netherlands, asked the EU last month to take further action against imports of low-quality recycled plastics which they said were being sold at heavily discounted prices. The EU also proposed rules specifying how chemically recycled products can count towards EU requirements for products to include recycled materials. Editing by Timothy Heritage"

The rarely-used eight-unit Fisk power plant owned by Houston-based NRG Energy was scheduled to retire next year. But then came electricity demands from artificial intelligence. Prices shot up in the country’s biggest power market – PJM Interconnection – as electricity requests from data centers exceeded existing supplies, sounding the alarm over power shortfalls, and making Fisk and other plants like it suddenly profitable. ""We believe there's an economic case to keep them around, so we withdrew the retirement notice,” said Matt Pistner, senior vice president of generation at NRG, of Fisk’s eight power-generating units. The Fisk power plant is among a growing number of so-called “peaker” electric generating units being pressed into duty across the U.S. as the nation’s electrical grids struggle to keep up with growing demand from data centers powering Big Tech’s investments in artificial intelligence. Peakers, which are meant to run only in short bursts during periods of spiking electricity demand, help stave off blackouts by supplying power on a moment’s notice. But there’s a trade-off: these often decades-old, fossil-fueled facilities emit more pollution when they are running and cost more to produce electricity than continuous power plants. A Reuters analysis of filings with the country’s biggest power grid shows that about 60% of oil, gas and coal power plants slated for retirement in PJM postponed or cancelled those plans this year. Most of the plants averting shutdowns are peaker units. The Fisk peakers were built on the site of a now-defunct coal-fired electricity generating station that operated for over a century. After years of fierce opposition by local residents, the coal plant shut more than a decade ago, but eight peaking units that run on petroleum oil continue to operate on the site. “When we found out that the coal plant was closing but there was still going to be power produced at the site, it was very disappointing,” said Jerry Mead-Lucero, a longtime advocate for the closure of the Fisk coal station who spent most of his adult life in Pilsen. Following the coal plant closure, pollution plummeted, but it didn’t vanish. Sulfur dioxide ranged from about 2 to as much as 25 tons per year from the site, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, as the eight-unit peaker plant occasionally lumbered to life to feed the grid. ""That's not an insignificant amount considering the low chimneys and homes nearby,"" said Brian Urbaszewski, Director of Environmental Health Programs for Respiratory Health Association, an Illinois nonprofit that focuses on helping people with respiratory disease. DIRTY POWER Because they were built for speed instead of efficiency, peakers often do not have pollution controls like mercury scrubbers, which remove the toxic chemical from the power plants’ emissions, and filters for particulate matter, according to academic and federal government research. Some also have lower smokestacks, or chimneys, environmental advocates say, meaning pollution can be more concentrated locally. Keeping peakers running longer may accelerate under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, which said it was exploring ways to tap into existing power sources , including peaker plants and other emergency systems, to quickly meet the massive new electricity demand. “There are a ton of peaker plants that could operate more,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Reuters in an interview in September, adding that clean air regulations have kept more from running more frequently. “The biggest targets are spare capacity on the grid today.” While peaker plants contribute about 3% of the country’s power, they have the total capacity to produce 19%, according to a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Tapping into that spare capacity, however, could mean more harmful emissions being spewed into neighborhoods that are often already overburdened with environmental hazards. The country's roughly 1,000 peaker plants are disproportionately located in low-income communities of color, according to academic and federal government research, meaning that extending the plants’ lives could leave vulnerable Americans to bear the brunt of more pollution. A 2022 study of formerly “redlined” U.S. communities, which were cut off from financial services like mortgages for being predominantly Black or immigrant, found that residents were 53% more likely to have had a peaker plant built nearby since the year 2000 than in non-redlined areas. “If you were a redlined neighborhood, you were more likely to have a fossil fuel power plant built nearby, and we saw that relationship was even stronger for peaker plants,” said UCLA professor of environmental health sciences Lara Cushing, who led the study. POWER DEMANDS STRAINING THE GRID Most of the country's peaker plants were built during two periods of growth in energy consumption: in the mid-20th century as electrical appliances became common household items, and at the turn of the millennium as the economy grew and computers gained popularity. Afterwards, as energy-sapping devices and infrastructure became more efficient, U.S. power demand waned and many fossil-fired power plants shut. Meanwhile, solar and wind farms, which only produce power when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing, began to supply more of the country’s energy.

The suspension was the latest blow for offshore wind developers that have faced repeated disruptions to their multi-billion-dollar projects under U.S. President Donald Trump , who has said he finds wind turbines ugly, costly and inefficient. State officials, Democratic lawmakers, offshore wind companies, and industry trade groups slammed the move as unjustified. The U.S. Department of the Interior said the decision was the result of complaints by the Pentagon that the movement of huge turbine blades for offshore wind projects, as well as the highly reflective towers that hold them up, cause radar interference that can make it hard to identify and locate security threats. The pause will give relevant federal agencies ""time to work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects,"" the department said in a statement.

worldoil,2025-12-23,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2025/12/23/offshore-expansion-drives-demand-for-logistics-hubs-across-the-caribbean/,"Rising offshore oil and gas activity across the Caribbean is elevating the strategic importance of onshore logistics infrastructure, as operators increasingly depend on specialized ports and shore bases to support complex offshore developments. As exploration success translates into sanctioned projects and rising production, the efficiency of offshore operations is becoming closely tied to the availability of well-designed logistics hubs. Purpose-built shore bases and upgraded ports now play a critical role in drilling support, subsea installation, vessel turnaround, materials handling and regulatory compliance—particularly in deepwater environments where downtime can carry significant costs. Guyanaprovides one of the clearest examples of this trend. The country’s rapid offshore production growth has been supported by dedicated logistics facilities, including the recently commissioned Vreed-en-Hoop Shore Base, as well as shore base operations run by private providers. These facilities offer integrated services ranging from pipe storage and drilling fluids to marine support and customs processing, helping operators maintain continuous offshore activity while reducing operational delays. In the southern Caribbean,Trinidad and Tobago’s Galeota Point has long served as a key logistics center supporting offshore gas production. Strategically located near producing fields, the facility provides supply base functions for drilling, maintenance and production campaigns, illustrating how logistics hubs can anchor upstream development while linking offshore assets to downstream infrastructure. Suriname, which is progressing major offshore discoveries toward development, is also expanding logistics capacity. Port facilities in and around Paramaribo have secured long-term contracts tied to offshore activity, while new supply base developments are being positioned to support drilling and future production. Logistics providers are expanding integrated oil and gas services as the country moves closer to first oil. Across the region, these developments highlight a common reality: offshore projects rely on proximity, reliability and operational readiness onshore. Modern logistics hubs must accommodate larger offshore support vessels, heavy subsea equipment and increasingly digitalized logistics systems, while meeting stringent safety, environmental and regulatory standards. Investment models for logistics infrastructure vary by country, with projects funded through combinations of private capital, public investment and public-private partnerships.

The bid round offers 22 exploration blocks—split evenly between onshore and offshore acreage—with an estimated 10 billion barrels of oil in place and an additional 18 billion barrels yet to be discovered. Updated fiscal terms include a discounted state take of about 66% and modeled internal rates of return approaching 20%, placing Libya among the more competitive production sharing regimes globally. Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) is targeting oil production capacity of 2 million bpd by 2030, a more than 40% increase from current levels. Achieving that goal would require a substantial acceleration in exploration and development activity, estimated at four to six times the pace seen over the past decade. While improved economics are drawing interest from major international operators, analysts caution that above-ground risks remain significant. Political fragmentation, payment reliability, infrastructure constraints and unresolved offshore boundary disputes continue to weigh on long-term investment confidence. Industry observers note that sustained progress on governance, security and institutional reform will be critical if Libya is to convert its resource potential into durable upstream growth and regain its role as a major global oil supplier."

worldoil,2025-12-22,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2025/12/22/shell-ineos-make-new-oil-discovery-in-norphlet-play-in-u-s-gulf/,"(WO) — Shell andINEOS Energyhave made their first oil discovery in the Gulf of America after confirming hydrocarbons at the Nashville exploration well, a deepwater Norphlet find operated byShell. The Nashville well, drilled in the Norphlet formation, was drilled more than five miles beneath the seabed and encountered high-quality oil in what the companies described as one of the Gulf’s most prospective deepwater plays. INEOS holds a 21% working interest in the discovery, while Shell operates the well with a 79% interest. The discovery could be tied back to Shell’s nearbyAppomattox platform, which is jointly owned by Shell and INEOS, subject to further technical and commercial evaluation. David Bucknall, CEO of INEOS Energy, said the find represents a milestone for the company’s U.S. offshore portfolio. “This is a good result for INEOS Energy and an important step in building our presence in the US Gulf where world-class resources are to be found and developed responsibly. We believe Nashville will help strengthen energy security and provide reliable supplies for many years to come,” Bucknall said. INEOS said the well was drilled using theDeepwater Proteus, one of the world’s most advanced offshore drilling rigs. Additional technical work is now under way to determine the size and commercial potential of the discovery. Heather Osecki, CEO of INEOS Energy’s U.S. Gulf business, said the results align with the company’s expectations for the play. “The drilling results at Nashville are very encouraging and fully in line with what we hoped to find. This discovery is an important first step in our plans to grow our existing assets while we look to further strengthen our position in the Gulf. We look forward to continuing our work to bring further value to the Appomattox host platform,” Osecki said."
worldoil,2025-12-22,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2025/12/22/block-energy-confirms-rapid-co2-mineralization-in-georgia-s-caucasus-ccs-pilot/,"(WO) —Block Energy plcsaid results from its Phase 1 carbon capture and storage (CCS) pilot in Georgia confirm rapid and permanent mineralization of injected carbon dioxide, marking a technical milestone for the project. Post-injection sampling and third-party laboratory analysis showed that between 70% and 100% of the CO₂ injected in August 2025 has mineralized within the reservoir. The company said the CO₂ precipitated into solid carbonate minerals in situ, providing evidence of permanent storage. As part of the pilot, 13.6 tons of CO₂ and a tracer compound were injected into the Middle Eocene reservoir through the PAT-49 well at the Patardzeuli field. Four connected monitoring wells were sampled during the monitoring phase, with formation water and surface gas measurements collected in line with international carbon and mineralization standards. No gaseous CO₂ was detected at surface, and formation water samples were independently analyzed by a laboratory in Azerbaijan. OPC, Block’s technical advisor, concluded that geochemical analysis of the samples demonstrated 70% to 100% mineralization within three months of injection. Tracer concentrations increased in the monitoring wells as expected, while dissolved CO₂ levels remained low, supporting the conclusion that the injected CO₂ had converted into solid minerals within the reservoir. Block said the pilot materially de-risks the project and provides a technical foundation for field-wide scale-up and commercialization. Early assessments estimate the Middle Eocene reservoir could store up to 151.5 million metric tons of CO₂ through mineralization under a mid-case scenario. Paul Haywood, chief executive officer of Block Energy, said the results validate the underlying storage mechanism. “These results are a major technical milestone for Block. Post-injection sampling and third-party laboratory analysis has confirmed rapid and permanent mineralization of CO2 in the reservoir, materially de-risking the project and enabling us to take the next steps toward development and commercialization,” Haywood said. He added that the project benefits from existing infrastructure and proximity to industrial CO₂ sources. “Mineralization provides a fundamentally different and higher-integrity form of storage as compared with conventional CCS and delivers permanent storage without the reliance on long-term trapping mechanisms,” Haywood said. Block said Phase 2 plans include refining storage capacity estimates, advancing independent certification of permanent storage, and evaluating commercialization pathways, including third-party storage and integration opportunities with joint venture partnerRustavi Azot, a subsidiary ofIndorama Corporation. Prakash Kejriwal, group director of Indorama Corporation, said the pilot supports continued development. “The interim results from the pilot conducted by Block’s team are very encouraging and provide a strong foundation for Phase 2 activities,” Kejriwal said."

worldoil,2025-12-22,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2025/12/22/kolibri-lifts-oklahoma-output-above-6-000-boed-as-new-wells-flow-back/,"(WO) —Kolibri Global Energy Inc.said production at its Tishomingo field in Oklahoma has climbed above 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day following the addition of new horizontal wells. The company said the current production rate includes volumes from offset wells that were temporarily shut in during recent fracture stimulation work. Some of those wells are now dewatering, while others are producing at higher rates than before being shut in. Kolibri recently completed fracture stimulations on four horizontal wells: Barnes 6-31-2H, Barnes 6-4H, Velin 12-9H and Velin 12-10H. All planned proppant volumes were placed, and the wells have begun flowing back fracture stimulation fluids. The two Barnes wells, in which Kolibri holds a 100% working interest, are averaging about 465 boed each, including roughly 395 barrels of oil per day. The wells are producing with an oil cut of about 85%, similar to the Lovina wells drilled earlier in the year. One Barnes well has a 1.5-mile lateral, while the other has a 1-mile lateral. On a normalized lateral-length basis, Kolibri said early production rates are slightly higher than those seen at the Lovina wells during initial flowback. Kolibri said it does not yet believe the full 1.5-mile lateral of the Barnes 6-31-2H is contributing to production. Production tubing is expected to be installed in early 2026, along with additional fracture fluid recovery, which the company said could further improve output. The Lovina wells, located on the southern portion of the acreage, continue to perform in line with expectations, showing lower decline rates than earlier wells. Kolibri said internal analysis based on four months of production data indicates the four-well Lovina pad would generate a 33% internal rate of return at a constant oil price of $60 per barrel and a 48% IRR at $70 oil. The two Velin wells, drilled about two years ago with a 97% working interest, are averaging roughly 200 boed, including about 145 barrels of oil per day. Kolibri said early production has been lower than anticipated, potentially due to extended shut-in periods during nearby completions and lower initial flowing pressures. Tubing is currently being run to improve fracture fluid recovery, and the company expects flow rates to improve. Wolf Regener, president and CEO of Kolibri, said overall field performance remains strong. “Overall, I’m very pleased with how well the field continues to perform, with current production over 6,000 BOEPD. It is great to see the high oil percentage of our recent wells, which is helping to improve the Company’s netbacks,” Regener said. He added that early results from the Barnes wells are tracking closely with prior expectations. “The early production profile of the Lovina wells was different than many of our previous wells, and we are glad to see them achieving the lower decline rates, predicted by our team, resulting in the strong forecasted IRRs. The early production data from the Barnes wells is very similar, including the high oil percentages, so we are hopeful that those wells will have similar results,” Regener said."

NOIA President Erik Milito said the federal permitting process already includes extensive review of national security implications, including coordination with the U.S. Department of Defense. “NOIA urges the administration to move promptly, in collaboration with the industry, to end the pause on construction of offshore wind projects for potential national security concerns,” Milito said. “The regulatory process involves a rigorous framework for assessing the national security implications of proposed projects, and every project under construction has already undergone review by the Department of Defense with no objections.” Milito said the existing process is designed to be consistent and transparent, with Defense Department involvement throughout planning and development. “The process, as required by law, provides a timely, transparent, and repeatable process to evaluate potential impacts and mitigation options related to offshore energy compatibility. The Department of Defense coordinates at every stage of planning, permitting, and development,” he said. NOIA also said offshore wind development supports broader U.S. energy and industrial objectives, including benefits for the oil and gas supply chain. “As NOIA emphasized to the administration earlier this year, offshore wind improves our national security by shifting economic, infrastructure, and geopolitical advantages to the U.S. through increased shipbuilding, enhancements to our ports, greater energy security to power surging electricity demand, more manufacturing and good-paying jobs, additional business for the oil and gas supply chain, and collaborative opportunities for our military,” Milito said. “In short, offshore wind helps the U.S. achieve its energy dominance goals.” The group warned that extended delays could weaken the United States’ competitive position, particularly relative to China. “America’s offshore energy industry has put thousands of Americans to work in high-paying jobs in the construction of offshore projects that will effectively meet burgeoning demand for power throughout the northeast,” Milito said. “We urge the administration end this pause and to resist taking further action that may harm jobs and investment, as well as undermine our economic and geopolitical competition with China.” Retired U.S. Army General James “Spider” Marks echoed those concerns, pointing to the scale of offshore wind development overseas. “America needs a strong offshore wind energy industry in order to compete with China,” Marks said, noting that China operates far more offshore wind projects than the United States."

worldoil,2025-12-19,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2025/12/19/tipro-backs-house-passage-of-speed-act-to-overhaul-federal-energy-permitting/,"(WO) — The Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) welcomed passage of H.R. 4776, known as the SPEED Act, by the U.S. House of Representatives, calling the legislation a critical step toward reforming federal permitting for energy infrastructure. The bill seeks to streamline environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, a process industry groups say has contributed to years-long delays for oil, natural gas and infrastructure projects. TIPRO has publicly supported the legislation, which now awaits action in the U.S. Senate. Ed Longanecker, president of TIPRO, said permitting reform is essential for the U.S. energy sector to meet growing domestic and international demand. “On behalf of our nearly 3,000 members, TIPRO applauds the passage of H.R. 4776 in the U.S. House of Representatives. Comprehensive permitting reform is a strategic imperative for our country and industry. Without it, America’s energy sector, particularly oil and natural gas, cannot operate at the pace or scale needed to meet domestic needs, support allies abroad, or ensure long-term affordability for consumers,” Longanecker said. He said prolonged federal reviews have delayed critical infrastructure projects, with broader economic impacts. “For too long, federal infrastructure approvals have languished in bureaucratic limbo, with critical energy projects delayed by years due to duplicative reviews, inconsistent agency coordination, and open-ended legal challenges,” he said. Longanecker also tied permitting delays to rising energy costs and future demand from data centers and artificial intelligence development. “Permitting paralysis has real-world consequences. American families feel it at the gas pump. Manufacturers see it in elevated energy costs,” he said, adding that growing power needs from AI-driven data centers will further increase demand for U.S. natural gas. The SPEED Act—formally titled the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act—was introduced in July by House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and co-sponsored by Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME). The bill proposes clearer definitions for federal actions under NEPA, firm timelines for environmental reviews and limits on legal challenges after final agency decisions. “For the oil and natural gas industry, comprehensive permitting reform is mission critical,” Longanecker said. “It unlocks investment, accelerates innovation, strengthens national security, and ensures that the United States remains a reliable energy partner to the world.” TIPRO urged the Senate to take up the legislation, though prospects for passage remain uncertain heading into 2026."

worldoil,2025-12-18,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2025/12/18/adnoc-secures-11-billion-financing-for-offshore-gas-development/,"(Bloomberg) – The biggest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates secured $11 billion in funding tied to future gas production from fields offshore in Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. and its peers are ramping up output of both oil and gas, even as analysts warn of looming supply gluts. Adnoc, however, says long-term demand for the fuels remains robust and will require significant investment. The Hail and Ghasha projects are expected to produce about 1.8 Bscf/d when they come online by the end of this decade. The financing was arranged along with partners including Italy’s Eni SpA and Thailand’s PTT Exploration & Production Pcl, according to a statement on Thursday. The financing was arranged by more than a dozen banks, including Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and Agricultural Bank of China. Citigroup Inc., Standard Chartered Plc and the UAE’s largest lenders First Abu Dhabi Bank and Emirates NBD also participated in the financing package. ADNOC last month announced a five-year, $150 billion capital-expenditure budget, in line with its previous spending plan. Much of that will go to boosting crude-output capacity to 5 MMbpd by 2027, an increase of about 25% since the expansion began. The company is also accelerating spending on natural gas as the UAE aims to become self-sufficient by the end of the decade. ADNOC now holds an 80% stake in the Ghasha gas concession after former partner Lukoil PJSC transferred its 10% share in November, according to a spokesperson. The U.S. has threatened to sanction companies that do business with Lukoil because of Russia’s continued war in Ukraine, prompting the Russian firm to shed overseas assets. ADNOC is among the companies interested in acquiring all or part of Lukoil’s international portfolio, Bloomberg has reported."

The bill aims to accelerate project approvals while maintaining environmental safeguards, an issue that pipeline operators and producers say has contributed to prolonged delays for major energy developments. Tina Faraca, executive vice president and chief operating officer of natural gas pipelines at TC Energy, said permitting reform is essential as U.S. energy demand continues to rise. “Affordable, reliable energy is essential for American families and businesses, especially as demand accelerates across a rapidly modernizing economy. Addressing that challenge begins with today’s passage of the SPEED Act in the House—a critical step toward a more effective permitting system,” Faraca said. She credited House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) for advancing the legislation and said the bill would support infrastructure development while protecting the environment. “By streamlining projects, the SPEED Act will lower consumer costs, support U.S. manufacturing, strengthen energy security, and boost America’s competitiveness,” Faraca said. TC Energy urged lawmakers to pursue additional permitting reforms as the bill moves through Congress. “We urge policymakers to continue building on this progress with broader permitting reforms—such as those outlined in the National Petroleum Council’s recent report—to deliver lasting benefits for American families and businesses,” she said."

NOIA President Erik Milito said the House vote signals broad agreement that federal permitting reform is needed to support domestic energy investment and production. “Today’s House passage of the SPEED Act reflects growing bipartisan recognition that America’s permitting system needs modernization. Permitting certainty is essential to keeping investment, jobs, and energy production in the United States, and the House vote is an important step in that direction,” Milito said. He noted, however, that revisions made after the bill moved through the House Natural Resources Committee deserve closer scrutiny as the legislation heads to the Senate. “At the same time, changes made to the legislation following its consideration in the House Natural Resources Committee warrant careful review. Permitting reform must avoid creating unintended consequences that undermine investment, delay projects, or reintroduce the very uncertainty the energy sector is seeking to resolve,” Milito said. Milito emphasized that predictable timelines and clear permitting processes are critical for long-term offshore and onshore energy development. “Certainty in permitting delivers certainty in investment. Clear timelines and predictable processes allow companies to commit capital, hire workers, and plan long-term projects that support American energy security and affordability,” he said. NOIA credited House lawmakers for advancing the legislation and called for a collaborative approach as the bill moves forward. “We appreciate the leadership of Representatives Golden and Stauber in continuing to advocate for permit certainty and Chairman Westerman’s continued commitment to improving the federal permitting framework,” Milito said. “As the Senate takes up this legislation, it is essential that Congress work collaboratively to deliver the strongest possible permitting reform, one that provides real certainty, avoids unintended consequences, and supports investment across the full spectrum of America’s energy economy,” he added."

The EIA said crude supply growth since 2023 has been led largely by producers outside the OPEC+ group. While coordinated OPEC+ production cuts offset non-OPEC gains in 2024, global output rebounded in 2025, rising an estimated 2.2 MMbpd. Non-OPEC producers contributed about 1.7 MMbpd of that increase, with Brazil, Guyana and Argentina responsible for roughly 28% of total global growth. In Brazil, crude oil output surged in 2025 following the start-up of new FPSOs in deepwater developments. Production exceeded 4.0 MMbpd for the first time in October, supported by the October start-up of Equinor’s Bacalhau field and additional capacity additions earlier in the year. The EIA forecasts Brazilian crude production will average about 4.0 MMbpd in 2026, supported by two additional FPSOs scheduled to come online at Petrobras’ Buzios field. Guyana continues to post one of the fastest oil production growth rates globally, with output rising nearly tenfold since 2020. Production averaged an estimated 750,000 bpd in 2025, driven by developments in the Stabroek Block operated by ExxonMobil, alongside partners Hess and CNOOC. The EIA noted that ExxonMobil’s Yellowtail project reached full capacity in late 2025, pushing Guyana’s production above 900,000 bpd in November. The start-up of the Uaru project in 2026 is expected to add 250,000 bpd, helping Guyana surpass 1.0 MMbpd by 2027. In Argentina, crude production growth is being driven by the Vaca Muerta shale play, one of the few unconventional oil basins outside the U.S. producing at scale. Argentine output is forecast to rise from about 740,000 bpd in 2025 to roughly 810,000 bpd in 2026, with Vaca Muerta accounting for more than 60% of national production. The EIA said combined growth from Brazil, Guyana and Argentina will remain a key factor shaping global supply balances as non-OPEC production continues to expand into 2026.

worldoil,2025-12-16,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2025/12/16/brent-crude-falls-below-60-as-global-surplus-pressures-prices/,"(Bloomberg) – Brent oil dropped below $60 a barrel for the first time since May, breaching a key level as supply outpaces demand and is on course to continue do so at a record clip next year. Brent fell as much as 1% to trade at $59.96 deepening a loss for the year, while West Texas Intermediate hovered around $56 a barrel. The prospect of a large oil surplus, driven by a wave of new supply from OPEC+ and countries in the Americas, as well as subdued demand growth, drove prices down gradually in 2025. Fresh hope for a deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine also chipped away at a longstanding geopolitical premium on crude oil. Still, markets are weighing the possible effects of a US pressure campaign against Venezuela."

Shell Offshore Inc. said the Kaikias waterflood project will involve injecting water into the reservoir to displace additional oil toward existing production wells while restoring reservoir pressure. First water injection is expected in 2028, with the project anticipated to extend the producing life of the Ursa platform by several years. The Kaikias field, discovered in 2014 in more than 4,000 ft of water, has been producing since 2018 via a subsea tieback to Ursa, one of the longest-producing deepwater hubs in the Mars Corridor. Shell holds a 100% working interest in Kaikias and is operator of the Ursa tension-leg platform. According to the company, the waterflood project is expected to add approximately 60 million barrels of oil equivalent (P50) in recoverable resources, currently classified as 2P under the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ resource classification system. The initiative follows Shell’s earlier decision to increase its ownership stake in Ursa, reinforcing its strategy of maximizing value from existing infrastructure in core deepwater assets. “Following our decision to increase our stake in Ursa earlier this year, this additional investment continues to maximize the value of the asset,” saidPeter Costello, Shell’s upstream president.

worldoil,2025-12-15,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2025/12/15/middle-east-oil-prices-weaken-as-regional-supply-outpaces-demand/,"(Bloomberg) – The Middle Eastern oil market has weakened in recent weeks on concern that regional supplies will outstrip demand, adding to signs of a softening global picture that’s weighed on benchmark crude futures. Among widely watched metrics, the premium of Abu Dhabi’s flagship Murban over Brent has declined to the narrowest since early October. The shift signals concern too much crude is being offered in the Middle East than can readily be bought by refiners in Asia at a time of higher, competing worldwide output. Global benchmark Brent is on pace for a third year of declines, as expectations that worldwide supplies will exceed consumption outweigh geopolitical concerns. Members of OPEC, including Mideast shippers such as Saudi Arabia, have added barrels just as rival drillers in the Americas also bolster output. Reflecting the abundant availability of near-term supplies, state producer Saudi Aramco recently cut the price of its flagship crude grade for Asia to the lowest level in five years. In addition, the Paris-based International Energy Agency forecasts that there will be a record global crude glut next year. “The surplus in the oil market is set to grow in 2026, following OPEC+’s decision to unwind supply cuts at a quicker-than-expected pace,” said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING Groep NV. “Non-OPEC supply is also expected to grow at a healthy clip despite this year’s price weakness.” Other markers in the Middle East are also flashing weakness. Among them, the Dubai benchmark’s discount to Brent, known as the Brent-Dubai EFS, was recently at its widest in about seven weeks. Within the region, differentials between some spot crudes and the Dubai benchmark have softened, according to General Index. Upper Zakum and Oman had a 50- to 60-cent premium to Dubai at the end of last week, down from about 90 cents at the start of the month. On a global basis, ING forecasts supply will rise 2.1 million barrels a day next year, while demand expands about 800,000 barrels. The IEA, meanwhile, projects output will exceed consumption by 3.8 million barrels a day in 2026. “The scale of the surplus and the expected build in inventory should put the forward curve under additional pressure,” said Patterson, referring to the pricing of crude over the coming months."

Several global players are expected to enter the southern portion of the basin in the coming months, followingChevron’s acquisition of Guinea-Bissau acreage earlier this year. Industry analysts note that while the northern MSGBC area has moved into an established production phase with developments in Senegal and Mauritania, the southern sector remains largely undrilled but geologically promising. “The south of the MSGBC basin has yet to deliver a major discovery, but interest is rising,” saidBen Sayers of GeoPartners. “Multiple companies are evaluating opportunities in The Gambia and Guinea-Conakry, and the recent entry of a supermajor into Guinea-Bissau could signal increased activity.” Advancements in deepwater acreage are also drawing attention. According toSLB’s Paul Freeman, deeper segments of the basin—largely unexplored—present new play concepts similar to those proven in Namibia’s Orange basin. “Once you go below 1,000 meters, there has been little exploration. The geology is favorable, and deeper plays could unlock significant potential,” he said. Regional governments are working to position the MSGBC basin as a competitive exploration hub. Countries are updating fiscal terms, improving regulatory structures and preparing new licensing opportunities to attract capital. National oil companies, including Senegal’s Petrosen, are taking a more active role in preliminary technical work to help de-risk acreage for incoming partners. “We know the geology is attractive. The challenge is making the basin competitive enough to draw more operators,” saidPetrosen CEO Alioune Guèye. Mauritania, aiming to accelerate progress on its BirAllah gas development, has recently strengthened investment terms and local content regulations to improve project economics and operational clarity. Record-breaking gas production from Senegal and Mauritania, coupled with rising international interest, suggests the MSGBC basin could become one of West Africa’s next major exploration frontiers—particularly as operators look toward underexplored deepwater zones and new southern plays."

Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission head Gbenga Komolafe said there were a total of 42 bids to harvest gas being flared at 49 sites in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, with the remaining 14 candidates still to meet the requirements for a permit. “Between 250 and 300 million standard cubic feet of gas will be captured and commercialized,” under the initiative, Komolafe told an event in Abuja, the capital on Friday. He said the move — part of a wider effort to curb Nigerian emissions to net zero by 2060 — will help attract up to $2 billion in investment and create more than 100,000 direct and indirect jobs. The NUPRC estimated that the initiative will eliminate roughly six million tons of carbon dioxide annually and support nearly three gigawatts of potential electricity generation capacity. Africa’s largest crude producer is estimated to have larger gas reserves than it has oil, but gas is routinely burned off during the oil production process because it’s not been commercially viable to utilize. The government wants to change this by providing incentives to the industry via the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Program. Nigeria’s gas output stood at about 221 billion standard cubic feet of gas in October, with about 7.6% of it flared according to information on the website of the NUPRC."

The deal, funded through existing liquidity, strengthens Harbour’s position as a leading producer in the UK North Sea. The acquisition adds approximately 20,000 boed in oil-weighted production and 35 million barrels of proven and probable reserves. It also increases Harbour’s operated stake in the Catcher field to 90% from 50% and brings a 29.5% non-operated interest in the Kraken oil field, creating a new production base in the Northern North Sea. Harbour said the transaction will be “immediately materially accretive” to free cash flow and improve the long-term resilience of its UK business. Integration of Waldorf’s non-operated assets is expected to deliver operational and financial synergies, including an estimated $350 million in cash release tied to decommissioning liabilities and access to Waldorf’s UK ring fence tax losses. Completion is expected in the second quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approvals and creditor settlements. “This transaction is an important step for Harbour in the UK North Sea, building on the action we’ve already taken to sustain our position in the basin given the ongoing fiscal and regulatory challenges,” said Scott Barr, Managing Director of Harbour’s UK Business Unit. “It stabilizes the Catcher joint venture partnership and delivers immediate cash flow benefits.

The two-well subsea tieback to the existing Atlantis platform is expected to add roughly 15,000 boed of gross peak annualized average production. Atlantis—one of bp’s longest-running deepwater hubs in the Gulf—has capacity to produce up to 200,000 bpd. The Drill Center 1 expansion extends the field’s footprint through a subsea hub that connects multiple wells to existing offshore infrastructure. bp said schedule acceleration was achieved through use of existing subsea inventory, improved drilling efficiency and streamlined offshore execution. “This project supports our plans to safely grow our upstream business, which includes increasing U.S. production to around 1 million boed by 2030,” saidGordon Birrell, bp’s EVP for production and operations. He added that the delivery of seven major projects this year demonstrates “the dedication of our U.S. project team and our teams around the world.” Atlantis Drill Center 1 is the second in a sequence of new Gulf of America projects expected to help bp lift its regional production to more than 400,000 boed by 2030. Earlier this year, bp brought the Argos Southwest Extension online—adding 20,000 bpd of gross peak production—and the company plans to deliver the Atlantis Major Facility Expansion in 2027. bp operates Atlantis with a 56% working interest, alongside co-owner Woodside Energy (44%)."

The decision comes eight months after Johan Castberg came onstream and continues the operator’s strategy to build the field into a long-term production hub for the region. The new subsea development, estimated to hold 46 MMbbl of recoverable oil, is expected to start up as early as Q4 2028. Equinor said the fast-track schedule is possible because the Isflak reservoir sits within the same license (PL 532) and is similar to existing Johan Castberg discoveries, enabling reuse of standardized equipment and well designs. “Johan Castberg has been developed as a future hub in the area. Isflak is the first of several discoveries now being matured for additional volumes,” saidTrond Bokn, Equinor’s SVP for project development. “This will have ripple effects for Norwegian suppliers.” Johan Castberg, which began production in March, is currently delivering around 220,000 bpd. Estimated recoverable volumes for the hub stand between 450–650 MMbbl, but Equinor sees significant upside—potentially 250–550 MMbbl from new wells and satellite tiebacks. Six new improved oil recovery wells are already planned, and the partnership is evaluating how quickly this year’s Drivis Tubåen discovery could be brought online. Equinor said the project reflects an evolving Norwegian continental shelf, where most future developments will be smaller finds rapidly tied back to existing infrastructure to reduce costs, emissions and extend field life. The Isflak concept includes two wells in a new subsea template tied back via pipelines and umbilicals to existing Johan Castberg facilities. All infrastructure will remain within the current license area. Equinor has applied to the Ministry of Energy for confirmation of impact assessment obligations and an exemption from submitting a full plan for development and operation.

worldoil,2025-12-11,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2025/12/11/brazil-output-rebounds-despite-november-decline-from-buzios-platform-shutdowns/,"(Bloomberg) – Brazilian oil output is rebounding from outages that removed more than 300,000 bpd last month, highlighting how Latin America’s largest crude producer can confound OPEC efforts to micromanage the market. Brazil’s daily oil production slid roughly 8% to an average of 3.696 MMbbl in November, according to Bloomberg calculations based on preliminary figures from oil regulator ANP. The drop from an all-time high the previous month stemmed from platform outages at offshore fields such as the mammoth Buzios. The volatility in output from a key non-OPEC oil producer highlights the challenges involved in assessing global crude-supply trends. The Saudi-led group of heavyweight oil nations is preparing to boost volumes early next year, and on Thursday predicted a balanced global crude market in 2026. OPEC’s outlook differs markedly from the likes of the International Energy Agency and influential traders such as Trafigura Group that are warning of an imminent supply glut. In Brazil, the data indicate that at least some of the affected platforms came back online in recent weeks. About one-fifth of last month’s lost production had been restored by late last week, according to the most recent ANP figures. The agency’s data is subject to subsequent adjustments. The November drop highlights how Brazil’s shift to “super platforms” that can pump more than 200,000 bpd each leaves the nation’s output vulnerable to sharp fluctuations, said Marcelo De Assis, a Rio de Janeiro-based independent oil consultant. The temporary blip, however, won’t derail the longer-term upward trend for Brazil and regional giants Guyana and Argentina, he said. Although the IEA trimmed estimates for a global oil surplus on Thursday, the agency is still expecting world supplies to exceed demand by 3.815 MMbpd in 2026."

Early results indicate estimated recoverable reserves of 15–25 Bcf, with production expected to exceed 8 MMcfed once the well is tied into Egypt’s national grid. The well is the fourth in the company’s $100 million development and exploration program, which includes 11 new wells aimed at boosting domestic gas supply, increasing reserves and supporting long-term output. Three wells drilled earlier this year added 10 MMcfd, and recompletion work on another three wells contributed an additional 9 MMcfd, bringing total new volumes from drilling and workovers to about 30 MMcfd. Dana Gas said the program is expected to add roughly 80 Bcf of recoverable reserves over its life. The company also plans to spud the next well in the campaign—the Daffodil exploration well—in early January 2026. “This latest success reinforces the value of our investment program in Egypt and highlights the significant remaining potential of the Nile Delta,” saidDana Gas CEO Richard Hall. “Increasing local gas production will help reduce Egypt’s reliance on imported LNG and fuel oil and is expected to deliver more than $1 billion in economic savings over time.” The company credited improved fiscal terms under its agreement with EGAS for securing additional acreage and accelerating drilling activity. Dana Gas noted that continued timely payments from partners will be essential for sustaining its investment plans in the country."

The IKA A-1 R DIR well, drilled by Crosco’s jackup rigLabin, is the first of two planned development wells in the current drilling campaign. Testing began in early December—around two months ahead of schedule—and initial production is averaging about 120,000 cu m/day of natural gas, making it INA’s second most productive gas well in Croatia. Gas produced during testing is being routed through existing infrastructure and delivered directly into Croatia’s national gas system. INA estimates the newly developed reserves at approximately 220 MMcm of natural gas, equivalent to about 1.3 MMboe. The wells are being developed through sidetracks from depleted parent wells, allowing INA to access previously untapped reservoirs while leveraging existing platform infrastructure. Work is continuing on the second development well, IKA A-4 R DIR, which is expected to be completed with a potential production start in first-quarter 2026. Both wells will be fully tied back to the IKA-A platform following completion and technical adjustments. INA said the project marks the start of a new offshore investment cycle aimed at boosting domestic gas output. Additional offshore drilling activities are planned through 2026, as the company looks to strengthen Croatia’s energy security amid ongoing volatility in global gas markets."

The CEO said he doesn’t know what President Donald Trump’s intentions are in the south Caribbean, where a US military build-up has prompted speculation the administration is looking to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. But Chevron has takes a “long view” on operating in Venezuela, Wirth said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “We operate there in full compliance with all U.S. law and sanctions,” he said. “We’re in discussions with the administration to ensure that we stay in compliance, that they understand the value that our presence brings to America.” Chevron is the only remaining U.S. oil major in Venezuela and has been operating under different sanctions waivers stretching back to the first Trump administration, resulting in stop-start operations. Its continued presence has been a thorny issue for both the Biden and Trump administrations, with some officials arguing it provides a financial lifeline to Maduro and others saying a U.S. operator is essential to maintaining stability in the country and global oil markets. “Our presence there, we believe, is important for the local economy, the regional economy, the people of Venezuela,” Wirth said. Venezuela’s reserves are the largest in the world, with more oil and gas than Saudi Arabia. “It’s right here in our hemisphere, very close to the Gulf Coast refining complex,” Wirth said. “We’ve been there through ups and downs and like many places in the world, we have to take a long view on our presence in countries like this.”"

worldoil,2025-12-10,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2025/12/10/spe-warns-africa-needs-375-billion-to-scale-natural-gas-development/,"Africa will require an estimated $375 billion in investment over the next 10 to 12 years to fully develop its natural gas resources and meet rising domestic and export demand, according to the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). The estimate was presented by Dr. Riverson Oppong, Africa Director at SPE, during a workshop at the MSGBC Oil, Gas & Power 2025 conference in Senegal. Despite holding roughly 8% of global natural gas reserves, Africa remains underrepresented in global gas markets due to policy constraints, infrastructure gaps and limited access to financing, SPE said. “Africa is a gas market,” Oppong said. “But despite our immense potential, we don’t participate meaningfully on the global stage. The constraints are policy, commercial frameworks, infrastructure and financing conditions.” SPE noted that several countries are working to address these challenges through integrated gas master plans, improved contractual terms and stronger institutional capacity. However, large-scale upstream and midstream investment will be required to translate recent discoveries into sustained production growth. According to industry data shared at the event, 17 high-impact exploration wells were completed across Africa in 2025, reinforcing expectations of continued upstream activity. SLB representatives said oil and natural gas demand on the continent is expected to increase by about 20% by 2050, driven by population growth, industrialization and power demand. SLB highlighted digital technologies as a key lever for improving exploration success, drilling efficiency and production optimization across African assets. Technologies including IoT, advanced analytics and artificial intelligence were cited as tools to enhance real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance and operational decision-making. “Data is a key focus area for improving the upstream value chain in Africa,” said Larry Velasco, Africa New Ventures Manager at SLB, noting that poor data quality can result in revenue losses of 15% to 25% for operators. Paul Freeman, Global Exploration Advisor at SLB, added that rising energy demand underscores the urgency of new investment. “Energy demand is increasing rapidly, and Africa’s oil and gas industry requires accelerated capital deployment to offset decline and meet peak demand,” Freeman said. SPE said continued collaboration between operators, service companies, governments and financial institutions will be critical to unlocking Africa’s gas potential and advancing long-term energy security across the continent.

(NPDP), a subsidiary of Navitas Petroleum, together with partnerRockhopper Exploration plc, has taken a final investment decision (FID) on theSea Lionoilfield development, clearing the way for the first producing project offshore the Falkland Islands. The Sea Lion field is located about 220 km north of the Falkland Islands and contains an estimated 319 million barrels of certified oil resources. Phase 1 of the development is designed to deliver peak production of approximately 50,000 bpd, with first oil targeted for the first half of 2028. Under the approved development plan, Phase 1 will comprise the drilling of 11 subsea wells tied back to a redeployed floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel. A second phase, expected within three years of first oil, would add an additional 12 wells, expanding plateau production and extending field life. NPDP plans to open an Aberdeen office in early 2026 to support delivery of the project, complementing existing teams in London and Stanley. Project execution will follow UK and international regulatory and operational standards, drawing on experience from previous exploration and appraisal activity in the basin. “The UK and Falkland Islands’ supply chain has already successfully delivered 29 exploration and appraisal wells in the region,” saidIan Ramsay, chief operating officer of NPDP. “The development will be progressed to industry and regulatory standards and create jobs both in the UK and the Falklands.” Beyond offshore development activity, NPDP said the project is expected to generate long-term employment across engineering, project management, manufacturing and operations, with economic benefits extending across the UK supply chain and into the Falkland Islands. The company plans targeted investments in housing and supply base infrastructure to support onshore operations while seeking to avoid pressure on existing local labor capacity. Sea Lion is expected to progress through multiple development phases over its operating life, with future planning to be coordinated from NPDP’s UK offices. NPDP holds a 65% interest in the project, with Rockhopper Exploration holding the remaining 35%. If brought fully onstream as planned, Sea Lion would establish a new producing basin in the South Atlantic, marking a major milestone for offshore development in the region."

TheBureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)on Wednesday concluded Lease Sale Big Beautiful Gulf 1 (BBG1), generating $279.4 million in high bids across 181 blocks covering roughly 80 million acres in federal waters of the Gulf of America. In total, 30 companies submitted 219 bids totaling $371.9 million. Interior Secretary Doug Burgumframed the sale as a cornerstone of the Trump administration’s effort to accelerate offshore development and reduce reliance on foreign energy supplies. “President Trump made clear from day one that the United States will no longer be held back by bad policy or foreign dependence,” Burgum said. “Today’s lease sale is another major milestone in rebuilding American Energy Dominance by unlocking investment, strengthening our energy security, creating jobs and ensuring Americans have access to affordable and reliable energy.” The lease sale fulfills requirements of theOne Big Beautiful Bill Act, enacted earlier this year, and supports Executive Order 14154, Unleashing American Energy, which directs federal agencies to streamline permitting and expand offshore oil and gas development. BOEM Acting Director Matt Giaconasaid industry participation reflected renewed confidence in federal offshore leasing. “The strong bidding we saw today reflects sustained industry confidence in the long-term potential of the U.S. outer continental shelf and the clear direction of this Administration to expand responsible offshore development,” Giacona said. For the first time in a decade, companies were permitted to attend the sale in person, with proceedings also livestreamed for public viewing. The final notice of sale was published in the Federal Register on Nov. 10, 2025, with a final statistical summary expected within 90 days. BOEM offered approximately 15,000 unleased blocks across the Western, Central and portions of the Eastern Gulf planning areas. To encourage participation, Interior applied a 12.5% royalty rate for both shallow- and deepwater leases—the lowest deepwater rate since 2007. Industry groups welcomed the sale as a long-awaited restart of offshore leasing after a two-year pause. “We applaud Secretary Burgum and Congress for restoring a clear path for long-term investment in the Gulf of America that strengthens U.S. energy leadership and security,” said Holly Hopkins,API’s vice president of upstream policy. “Today’s sale marks the beginning of a new generation of opportunity for safe, responsible development in the Gulf.” TheNational Ocean Industries Association (NOIA)echoed that sentiment, calling the sale foundational to U.S. energy production. “The door has reopened to the Gulf of America,” saidNOIA President Erik Milito. “After two long years without lease sales, this is a milestone for America’s energy future. Leasing attracts investment, supports jobs in all 50 states, and provides a fair return to taxpayers.” The Gulf of America accounts for 97% of offshore U.S. oil and gas production, contributing about 14% of total U.S. crude output and 2% of natural gas production. The region’s outer continental shelf holds an estimated 29.6 billion barrels of undiscovered oil and 54.8 Tcf of natural gas. Interior officials said additional Gulf lease sales are expected as part of a renewed offshore strategy aimed at strengthening national security, sustaining Gulf Coast communities and maintaining U.S. global energy leadership."
